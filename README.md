# Pima-Indian-diabetes-analysis
Analysing Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition that develops when the pancreas either produces insufficient amounts of insulin (which moves sugar or glucose from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy ) or when the body cannot properly use the insulin that is produced.
The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) has been taken from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables (pregnancies, glucose,BloodPressure,SkinThickness,Insulin,BMI, diabetes, pedigree function, and age) and one target variable, outcome.
 All patients are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
Predicting the onset of diabetes based on the medical predictor variables of the individual by ML algorithms like Decision tree,Random forests,Support Vector Classifier (SVC),XGBoost,Naive bayes,AutoSklearnClassifier.
